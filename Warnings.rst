Warnings
#########################

When flying drones it is important to be aware of two things. Batteries and propellers. If
the batteries are damaged and have bumps or dents, please do not try to use them,
as they can burst into flames. In relation to the propellers, always be careful when handling
the drone, since moving propellers can cause serious damage. To gain the appropriate
caution it can be recommended to search for drone propellers accidents or watch this `Link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQoTQZcwZWE&ab_channel=DroneImpact-AalborgUniversity>`_ .
